	Dalvik is the process virtual machine (VM) in Google's Android operating system. It is the software that runs the apps on Android devices.
 Dalvik is thus an integral part of Android, which is typically used on mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers as well as 
 more recently on embedded devices such as smart TVs and media streamers. Programs are commonly written in Java and compiled to bytecode.
 They are then converted from Java Virtual Machine-compatible .class files to Dalvik-compatible .dex (Dalvik Executable) files before installation on a device.
 The compact Dalvik Executable format is designed to be suitable for systems that are constrained in terms of memory and processor speed.
	Android uses the Dalvik virtual machine with just-in-time compilation to run Dalvik bytecode, which is usually translated from Java bytecode. 
Every Android application runs in its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine. Dalvik has been written so that a device can run multiple VMs efficiently. The Dalvik VM executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is optimised for minimal memory footprint. The VM is register-based, and runs classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into the .dex format by the included “dx” tool.

2. Differentiate between mobile and cloud computing

Cloud computing, one of the new buzz words of 2008, allows you to store your files and folders in a “cloud” area on the Internet, allowing you access to all of your files and folders wherever you are in the world – but you do need a physical device with Internet access to access it.
Privacy:The increased use of cloud computing services such as Gmail and Google Docs has pressed the issue of privacy concern of cloud computing services to the utmost importance. The provider of such services lie in a position such that with the greater use of cloud computing services has given access to a plethora of data. This access has the immense risk of data being disclosed either accidentally or deliberately.Privacy advocates have criticized the cloud model for giving hosting companies' greater ease to control—and thus, to monitor at will—communication between host company and end user, and access user data (with or without permission).

Mobile computing is taking a physical device with you. This could be a laptop or a mobile phone or some device which enables you to telework – working wherever you go because of the small size of the device you’re using.Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software. Communication issues include ad hoc and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties,protocols, data formats and concrete technologies. Hardware includes mobile devices or device components. Mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications. Portability is one aspect of mobile computing. Devices are Personal digital assistant/enterprise digital assistant,Smartphone,Tablet computer and Ultra-Mobile PC. Security issues involved in mobile computing:Different security counter-measures are being developed and applied to smartphones, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users.

3>Give an example of an application simulating an environment of  context aware computing and justify.

Sensors can be used to sense different environmental characteristics such as temperature, acceleration, humidity etc. Location in terms of GSM cell IDs and location area codes can also be considered as a signal, in essence, sensed by a mobile phone. Despite the fact that such sensor signals are considered as the basis of context awareness surprisingly little effort has been put into understanding the nature of these signals as they might appear in real situations. Due to the fact that these sensors are smaller, cheaper with low power consumption can also mean that the quality and stability of the sensors may not be as expected. Some properties of sensors and their ability to sense can be described as follows.

Accuracy Capacity of the sensor to give results close to the true value. Resolution Minimal change of the input necessary to trigger a detectable
change at the output.

Precision Capacity of the sensor to give the same results for the same inputunder the same conditions.

Sensitivity The slope of the calibration curve, which is a graphical display of the calibration record.

Response time Time between the occurrence of a constant change in the input and the time the sensor output has reached a percentage (i.e. 95%) of the value of the input.

Systematic errors Results from: interfering or modifying variables (i.e. temperature), drift (i.e. changes in mechanical stresses), measurement process,
transmission process, human observers. Systematic errors can be corrected with compensation methods.

Random errors / noise True random errors follow a Gaussian distribution and come from environment noise, transmission noise, signal to noise ratio.
Drift Change in the signal over a long period of time.
